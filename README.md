latis-ngdc
==========

Experimental access to some datasets from NGDC

This project depends on the LaTiS core and latis-netcdf. To get up and running, clone these three projects:

 git clone https://github.com/dlindhol/LaTiS.git

 git clone https://github.com/dlindhol/latis-netcdf.git

 git clone https://github.com/dlindhol/latis-ngdc.git

To build a war file to be deployed to your app server, go to the latis-ngdc directory and run (assuming Unix):

./gradlew war

More documentation coming soon to https://github.com/dlindhol/LaTiS/wiki
